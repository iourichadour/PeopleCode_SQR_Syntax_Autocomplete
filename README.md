PeopleCode and SQR and syntax autocomplete files for Notepad++

For installation instructions please go to 
http://workingscripts.com/2009/06/notepad-peoplecode-sqr/

<b>functionList.xml</b> - will allow you to see and navigate to the methods and functions in the Function List window

<b>userDefineLang.xml</b> - contains the syntax highlighting and the autocomplete for SQR and PeopleCode.

I hope that everyone who uses this functionality will take the time to add or correct any issues that  may come up.
